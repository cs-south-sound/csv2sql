# ETL Multiple CSVs Into MySQL Database
This repository provides an example of using Python3 to take a directory of multiple CSVs and
Extract, Transform, and Load (ETL) the data into a local MySQL database. The ETL scripts are 
set up for working with a directory of CSVs for (Ark Invest Funds)[https://ark-funds.com/our-etfs/] 
daily breakdowns. CSVs detailing the full holdings in their funds are updated each open day of the 
NYSE and can be downloaded from their website.
